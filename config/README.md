## Configuration for config.yml

For privacy reasons, we're not including our own API keys here. If you want them, then please provide your own!

### Syntax for config.yml file:

```yaml
API_key: <API_KEY>
API_secret_key: <API_secret_key>
Access_token: <Access_token>
Access_token_secret: <Access_token_secret>
```

### Getting these credentials:

Getting these credentials isn't too hard. Here's some youtube videos that should help you get them. They total ~15 mins, so it won't take long. It's also a one time thing, so don't worry about running into this again and again!
