# Twitter-Public-Analysis

![Build](https://github.com/Twitter-Public-Analysis/Twitter-Public-Analysis/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

Hey! We're working on making a twitter analysis tool that can analyze tweets in real time and give us valuable insights

Interested in working with us? Join our discord [here](https://discord.com/channels/729368876965429310/729368876965429313)!

## Getting Started

Getting started shouldn't be too hard. Here are the steps:

1. Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/Twitter-Public-Analysis/Twitter-Public-Analysis.git`

2. Install the requirements

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. And you're done with the initial setup!

Great! Now you can work with Dozent (The powerful downloader that can download and preprocess the massive datasets!), and Morpheus (The robust set of tools that you'll use to process those massive datasets). We'll link their repositories soon.

## Running tests (to make sure that our code works)

`pytest`
